Projects
1. Patient Appointment No-Show Analysis
Date: January 2025
Description:
In this project, I analyzed a hospital's appointment dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing patient no-shows. Key variables such as appointment day, patient demographics, appointment day, times, and no-show status where examined. 

Tools and Techniques:
	• MySQL:- Querying data using MySQL to extract relevant information.
	• Excel:-Data Cleaning & Preprocessing.
	• Python:- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
	• Power Bi:- Dashboard Visualizations.
	• Dataset: Kaggle dataset with 1.1 lakh rows and 18 columns.

Key Insights:
Through this analysis, I discovered key factors influencing patient no-shows, including demographics, age, health issues, SMS reminders, and scheduled appointment times. These insights revealed patterns, such as higher no-show rates in specific age groups and for patients with certain health conditions. Based on the findings, I provided actionable recommendations, including optimizing appointment schedules, enhancing SMS reminder strategies, and tailoring communication for specific patient demographics, to help reduce no-show percentages effectively.

Skills Demonstrated:
	• Data preprocessing and cleaning
	• Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
	• Data visualization using Power BI, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
	• Actionable insights and  recommendations
	• Handling large datasets efficiently
