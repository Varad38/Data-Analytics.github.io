## Projects

### 1. Patient Appointment No-Show Analysis

#### Description:
In this project, I analyzed a hospital's appointment dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing patient no-shows. Key variables such as appointment day, patient demographics, appointment times, and no-show status were examined.

#### Tools and Techniques:
- **MySQL:** Querying data using MySQL to extract relevant information.
- **Excel:** Data cleaning & preprocessing.
- **Power BI:** Dashboard visualizations.
- **Dataset:** Kaggle dataset with 1.1 lakh rows and 18 columns.

#### Key Insights:
Through this analysis, I discovered key factors influencing patient no-shows, including demographics, age, health issues, SMS reminders, and scheduled appointment times. These insights revealed patterns, such as higher no-show rates in specific age groups and for patients with certain health conditions. Based on the findings, I provided actionable recommendations, including:
- Optimizing appointment schedules
- Enhancing SMS reminder strategies
- Tailoring communication for specific patient demographics

These recommendations were aimed at helping reduce no-show percentages effectively.

#### Skills Demonstrated:
